## CPU Stress Tester
If you're anthing like me you love to push your PC hardware to its absolute maximum by overclocking.
However, sometimes we get carried away and push our CPU beyond its limits. This program is a CPU 
stress test to stress your CPU and check for stable overclocks.

## How It Works
The program stresses your CPU by calculating extremely large prime numbers (inspired by prime 95).
First the program uses C#'s Management API to get information about your CPU like its 
name and the number of logical processors it contains. Then it runs a prime number calculation algorithm
on all threads to max out your CPU.
